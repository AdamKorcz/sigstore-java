# sigstore-java
A sigstore java client for interacting with sigstore infrastructure

This is a WIP, currently only consists of a fulcio client and some tests

To be added
- rekor client
- dex/oidc client

Maybe to be added here or somewhere else
- signer
- java tuf client (might be useful outside of the sigstore ecosystem)
